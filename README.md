# GuardBot
A differential‑drive autonomous robot that fuses stereo‑depth and 3D LiDAR data for real‑time exploration and SLAM‑based mapping. It overlays live person‑detection results onto the generated map, enabling precise localization and tagging of individuals as the robot navigates its environment.
